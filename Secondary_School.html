          <p>""I am Mr. Abiodun, the parent of Mr. David Abiodun, a new intake student in the third term session at God's Pride School. I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to God's Pride School for the exceptional care and affection they have shown towards my son, Mr. David Abiodun. We have not had a single moment of regret since we made the decision to enroll him in God's Pride School. Ever since he became a part of the God's Pride family, we have witnessed remarkable improvements in his growth and development. He successfully passed his common entrance examination to JSS class, meeting the required cut-off mark.
            <br><br>
            The teaching methodology and diverse activities provided at God's Pride School are truly outstanding. I extend my sincere gratitude for the remarkable care and affection you have showered upon my son. Your school's dedication and commitment have provided him with the invaluable opportunity to become a member of the God's Pride School family. I have every confidence that his future is in secure hands. Our admiration and gratitude are extended to everyone at God's Pride School. Thank you.""</p>

          <p>"Choosing God's Pride Schools has proven to be one of the most rewarding decisions we have ever made for our child. Watching our child thrive and exceed our expectations is a source of immense joy, and this achievement is undoubtedly attributed to the incredible dedication of his teachers: Mrs. James, Mrs. Fadeni, and Mrs. Ikumapayi. Their commitment brings us a sense of comfort as they understand our family dynamics.
            <br><br>
            Our child's well-being is a top priority, and we are elated to hear about the daily fun experiences he shares with us. Knowing that our child is under the care of such nurturing hands reaffirms our confidence in choosing God's Pride.
            <br><br>
            A special acknowledgment goes to Mr. Ajibade, whose celebration of each student's achievements has played a pivotal role in nurturing our child's confidence and enthusiasm for learning.
            <br><br>
            With heartfelt gratitude, we extend our thanks to the entire team. Your collective efforts have touched our hearts deeply."</p>

          <p>"My son, Temilade Saka, joined this God-blessed College in SS1 (Basic 10) during the 2020/2021 academic session. Obviously, he had been with another school for his JSS classes. My family broke ties with the former school not on academic incapability but for reasons of principle that are not worthy of mentioning here, especially when the school will not be available to state its own side.
            <br><br>
            In a desperate search for an alternative that is an equally reputed and academically good secondary school that fears the Lord and does not compromise in both its internal and external examinations, I contacted a church member and sisters family friend. She mentioned Gods Pride College, Ota. Her testimonies about Gods Pride College as an educationist and a mother with her children in the school were disarming, convincing and irresistible. The school name was not unfamiliar but did not really know the brains behind the Citadel of Learning.
            <br><br>
            I came to the school to make an enquiry. I was impressed with the warm reception I received from Miss Akinbode. This further reinforced my conviction that I was making the right choice. I later called her before paying the school fees. She said she had left the school. I was shocked. On further enquiry, she said, I have moved on for greener pasture and I will always recommend the school to any parent that wanted the best for his child. A very suiting and independent testimony from former staff, I cannot agree less. I was later to know other academic staff and the good stuff they are made of. A pleasant experience indeed.
            <br><br>
            The school combines and excellently imparts to the students sound moral, spiritual and rich academic knowledge. I am enthused with the Colleges flexible arrangement that could accommodate exigencies. Gods Pride College is ahead of its peers not only playing the role of destiny helper but also by acting like biological parents of the students. There is goal congruence in Gods Pride College, Ota.
            <br><br>
            At the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) meetings, I attended a couple of them, the school is a good listener and in a class of its own. No matter how unreasonable and seemingly time-wasting a parent might be, no one is shut down. All concerns are maturely handled and humbly respected all views. Every parent has a voice in the matter concerning their children and wards. A thump up for Gods Pride College, Ota is an example of a team player.
            <br><br>
            The response time to enquiry concerning issues, no matter the time of the day is unparalleled.
            <br><br>
            I will always recommend this school to others my son, having passed through the school, is a living testimony of a school of first choice to a parent who desires the best for their children.
            <br><br>
            I needed to be this detailed to prove a point that Gods Pride College, Ota is a pride of God.
            <br><br>
            I wish the school, management and staff more giant strides and breakthroughs and elegant academic successes that will not only shake Ota or Ogun State but indeed the whole of Nigeria.
            <br><br>
            All hail Gods Pride College, Ota."
