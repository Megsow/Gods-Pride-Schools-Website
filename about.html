          <h3>The Proprietor</h3>
          <p>
            Mrs. Sowunmi O. Mojisola, an extraordinary educator, responded to a divine calling to nurture children and
            youth. She and her husband Mr. Oludare O. Sowunmi founded God's Pride Schools and God's Pride Educational
            Consultancy. As CEO, she orchestrates collaborative efforts, elevating standards and opportunities. She
            holds a Higher National Diploma in Science Laboratory Technology and a PGD in Education from Lagos State
            University. Her academic journey continued with two Master's degrees—one in Educational Planning and
            Management from South America University and another in Innovation in Learning and Teaching from the
            University of South Wales, UK. She completed Montessori and educational psychology courses and actively
            participated in Ogun State Ministry of Education seminars. Her commitment to growth is evidenced by
            certifications, including an honorary Doctor of Philosophy in Educational Psychology and Management from
            Prowess University Delaware, USA.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, Mrs. Mojisola's commitment to spiritual values is evident through her membership in the African
            Church Evangelical Fellowship. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, she is a cherished wife and mother, blessed with a
            family of responsible children. Her journey embodies an unwavering commitment to education, faith, and
            impactful contributions to individuals and communities.

        <h3>The Mandate</h3>
        <p>God's Pride School is a mandate and a God-given school born out of the vision and mission to raise a
          generation of new academics founded on Godly values. That is why our Motto for the Primary School is "Firm
          Foundation." We are called to raise a child firmly rooted and established in God. Colossians 2:7.</p>

        <h3>Our Values</h3>
        <p>Our values are based solely on the word of God (2 Peter 1:5-7). At God's Pride School, we also teach our
          pupils and students practical life skills, vocational and entrepreneurial skills, life skills values, good
          etiquette and manners, Jolly phonics, and diction; how to speak right so that they will be able to stand out
          anywhere they go. Apart from academics, we help our students to develop holistically. The students are
          inspired and encouraged to work hard to achieve all-around excellence in life and also to develop their
          leadership qualities.</p>

      <div class="about-section entrepreneurship">
        <h3>God's Pride Entrepreneurship Centre</h3>
        <p>All students, irrespective of their chosen area of discipline, must take two entrepreneurship courses, of
          which computer education is compulsory. Other courses we will be introducing will include electrical
          installation and maintenance, catering and hospitality management, tailoring and fashion design, hat making,
          leather goods production, event decoration, and planning. This is to ensure every student of the college
          acquires a minimum of two skills he/she can practice to generate income during and after graduating from the
          college.</p>
