          <h3>Our Founder</h3>
          <p>Mrs. Sowunmi O. Mojisola is an extraordinary educationist whose profound dedication to nurturing children and young adults was divinely ignited. Her vision led her to establish an educational institution that has not only left an indelible mark on society but continues to shape and transform the minds of the youth.

She then pursued a National Diploma in Science Laboratory Technology at the Federal Polytechnic, Maro, graduating in 1993. Her commitment to excellence led her to complete a Higher National Diploma at the same institution in 1996.
            
            Eager to advance her expertise and further her contributions to education, Mrs. Sowunmi earned a Post Graduate Diploma in Education from Lagos State University in 2003.

These seminars, such as 'Administration of Continuous Assessment within the School System' and 'Discipline Management in Schools,' have equipped her with a comprehensive skill set, enabling her to lead with insight and effectiveness.
            
            Furthermore, Mrs. Sowunmi's commitment to continuous growth is exemplified by her participation in various training programs and the acquisition of numerous certifications. Her professional development includes Child Psychology (2020), a STEM Educator Certificate Course by CODEFEST (2021), Jolly Phonics CPD College (2022), and a diploma in educational psychology from Alison (2022). Notably, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Philosophy in Educational Psychology and Management from Prowess University Delaware, USA.
            
            Her professional journey includes serving as a Laboratory Technologist at Palmer Memorial Hospital, Ikot Usen, Akwa-Ibom State. She also worked as a Laboratory Technician with Farmes Meyer Ltd, Sango, Ogun State, from 1995 to 1996.
            
            Beyond her remarkable professional accomplishments, Mrs. Mojisola's commitment to spiritual values is evident through her active membership in the African Church Evangelical Fellowship. Her contributions to evangelism and church planting have been acknowledged and commended by the African Church, Awori Diocese Evangelical Team.
            
            Born in August 1975 in Lagos, Nigeria, Mrs. Mojisola is a cherished wife and mother, blessed with a family of responsible children. Her journey exemplifies an unwavering commitment to education, faith, and making a profound impact on the lives of individuals and communities.</p>
