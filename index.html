              at God's Pride School. I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to God's Pride School for
              the exceptional care and affection they have shown towards my son, Mr. David Abiodun. We have not
              had a single moment of regret since we made the decision to enroll him in God's Pride School. Ever
              since he became a part of the God's Pride family, we have witnessed remarkable improvements in his
              growth and development. He successfully passed his common entrance examination to JSS class,
              meeting the required cut-off mark.
              <br><br>
              The teaching methodology and diverse activities provided at God's Pride School are truly
              outstanding. I extend my sincere gratitude for the remarkable care and affection you have showered
              upon my son. Your school's dedication and commitment have provided him with the invaluable
              opportunity to become a member of the God's Pride School family. I have every confidence that his
              future is in secure hands. Our admiration and gratitude are extended to everyone at God's Pride

              <br><br>
              Their relationship with parents and pupils is what I cherish most. They are all loving, caring and
              supportive.
              <br><br>
              And I will implore the School management if there is something they are doing to get that from the

              I really appreciate it.

            <p>"Choosing God's Pride Schools has proven to be one of the most rewarding decisions we have ever
              made for our child. Watching our child thrive and exceed our expectations is a source of immense
              joy, and this achievement is undoubtedly attributed to the incredible dedication of his teachers:
              Mrs. James, Mrs. Fadeni, and Mrs. Ikumapayi. Their commitment brings us a sense of comfort as they
              understand our family dynamics.

              Our child's well-being is a top priority, and we are elated to hear about the daily fun experiences

              confidence in choosing God's Pride.

              A special acknowledgment goes to Mr. Ajibade, whose celebration of each student's achievements has
              played a pivotal role in nurturing our child's confidence and enthusiasm for learning.

          <div class="testimonial-content">
            <p>"My son, Temilade Saka, joined this God-blessed College in SS1 (Basic 10) during the 2020/2021
              academic session. Obviously, he had been with another school for his JSS classes. My family broke
              ties with the former school not on academic incapability but for reasons of principle that are not
              worthy of mentioning here, especially when the school will not be available to state its own side.
              <br><br>
              In a desperate search for an alternative that is an equally reputed and academically good secondary
              school that fears the Lord and does not compromise in both its internal and external examinations,
              I contacted a church member and sisterâ€™s family friend. She mentioned Gods Pride College, Ota. Her
              testimonies about Gods Pride College as an educationist and a mother with her children in the
              school were disarming, convincing and irresistible. The school name was not unfamiliar but did not
              really know the brains behind the Citadel of Learning.
              <br><br>
              I came to the school to make an enquiry. I was impressed with the warm reception I received from
              Miss Akinbode. This further reinforced my conviction that I was making the right choice. I later
              called her before paying the school fees. She said she had left the school. I was shocked. On
              further enquiry, she said, I have moved on for greener pasture and I will always recommend the
              school to any parent that wanted the best for his child. A very suiting and independent testimony
              from former staff, I cannot agree less. I was later to know other academic staff and the good
              stuff they are made of. A pleasant experience indeed.
              <br><br>
              The school combines and excellently imparts to the students sound moral, spiritual and rich
              academic knowledge. I am enthused with the Colleges flexible arrangement that could accommodate
              exigencies. Gods Pride College is ahead of its peers not only playing the role of destiny helper
              but also by acting like biological parents of the students. There is goal congruence in Gods Pride
              College, Ota.
              <br><br>
              At the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) meetings, I attended a couple of them, the school is a
              good listener and in a class of its own. No matter how unreasonable and seemingly time-wasting a
              parent might be, no one is shut down. All concerns are maturely handled and humbly respected all
              views. Every parent has a voice in the matter concerning their children and wards. A thump up for
              Gods Pride College, Ota is an example of a team player.
              <br><br>
              The response time to enquiry concerning issues, no matter the time of the day is unparalleled.
              <br><br>
              I will always recommend this school to others my son, having passed through the school, is a
              living testimony of a school of first choice to a parent who desires the best for their children.
              <br><br>
              I needed to be this detailed to prove a point that Gods Pride College, Ota is a pride of God.
              <br><br>
              I wish the school, management and staff more giant strides and breakthroughs and elegant academic
              successes that will not only shake Ota or Ogun State but indeed the whole of Nigeria.
              <br><br>
              All hail Gods Pride College, Ota."
